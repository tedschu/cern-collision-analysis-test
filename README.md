# CERN Electron-Positron Collision Data Analysis

Analysis of electron-positron collision data from CERN's Large Electron-Positron collider

## Overview 

This project analyzes 10,000 collision events from CERN, exploring the relationship between particle energy, momentum, and invariant mass.

## Dataset

**Source:** CERN electron-positron collision data (via Kaggle)
**Dataset size:** 10,000 collision events

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.13**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive analysis environment

## Project Goals 

This project was built in order to better familiarize myself both with data analysis and manipulation with Python and packages such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, as well as to work with real scientific datasets
